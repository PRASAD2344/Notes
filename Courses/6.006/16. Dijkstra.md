1. Triangle in equality
2. Take care of cycles, when using negative weights; Can't have negative cycles.

**Shortest path alogirthm**
1. O|V+E|
1. Can't have cycles, but can have negative weights
1. Toplogically sort DAG. Path from u to v denotes that u is before v in the graph. ???
2. One pass left to right over the vertices in topologically sorted order relaxing the each edge that leaves each vertex

**Dijkstra**
1. Graphs with cycles but no negative weights
2. Greedy algorithm
3. Goes vertex by vertex

**Pseudo Code**
1. Dijkstra(G,W,S)
2. Find node which can be reached with minimum distance from node 'u'
3. Relax all edges emanating from 'u' and update path values

**Complexity**
1. O(V) - Inserts into priority queue
2. O(V) - Extract from operation
3. O(E) - Decrease key operation
4. Arrays for priority queue - O(V) extract min, O(1) decrease key; O(V.V + E.1) = O(V.V + V.V) as E is V.V = O(Vpow2)
5. Min Heap - O(log V) extract min, O(log v) decrease key; O(V.log V + E.log V) = O(VlogV + Vpow2logV) as E is V.V
6. Fibonacci Heap - O(log V) extract min,O(1) amortized key for decrease key = O(VlogV+E) = O(VlogV)


**Code Run**
1. S = {} {A,B,C,D,E}
2. S = {A} 0 Inf Inf Inf Inf
3. S = {A,C} 0 10 3 Inf Inf //Relax edges of vertex A, means update all paths emanating from A
4. S = {A,C,E} 0 7 3 11 5 //Relax edges of vertex C
