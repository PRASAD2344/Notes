1. Careful brute force
2. subproblems + "reuse"

> **Fibonacci Numbers**
1. Memoized Dynamic Programming Algorithm
2. ```fib(n)
    if n in memo: return memo[n];
    if n<=2 : f = 1
    else: f = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    memo[n]=f;
    return f;```
3. O(n) as total work done is constant
4. memoize & re-use solutions to sub-problems that help solve the problem
5. `recursion + memoization`
6. time = sum of time taken for each sub problem
7. Don't count recursions

> **Bottom-up DP Algorithm**
1. ```
   fib = {}
   for k in range(1,n+1):
    if k <= 2: f = 1
    else: f = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]
    fib[k] = f
   return fib[n]
   ```
2. In the above problem, we can save space by keeping the last two and deleting others 
2. Topological sort of sub-problem dependency DAG

> **Shortest Paths**
1. O(V+E)
2. Based on in-degree at a vertex
3. Sub-problem dependencies should be acyclic
