1. Cycle detection
2. Topological sort
3. Recursion - Recursively explore the graph, backtracking as necessary
4. Don't repeat vertices
5. Recursion can be applied on adjaceny list or vertices(for disconnected graph/not strongly connected graph)
6. Stack can be eliminated as we are using recursion

>### **Analysis**
1. O(|V|+|E|) - Linear time
2. O(|E|) - For DFS_VISIT
3. O(|V|) - For outer loop

>### **Edge Classification**
1. [Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-back-edge-and-cross-edges-in-dfs-of-graph/)
1. Tree Edge - Stored visited edges
2. Forward Edge - Similar to backward edge. If state is in 'Completed' state, then it's forward edge
3. Backward Edge - Indicates cycle in graph; Indicated by presence of correspoding node in the stack while doing recursion; one way to do this is having field added to node to denote 'InProcess' and 'Completed'
4. Cross Edge - Goes from one tree to another, doesn't have common ancestor in a directed graph
5. For undirected graph, we can only have tree and cross edges

>### **Cycle Detection**
1. G has a cycle iff DFS has a back edge

>### **Topological Sort/Job Scheduling**
1. [Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)
1. Given directed acyclic graph, order vertices so that all edges points from lower order to higher order
2. Run DFS
3. Return reverse of finishing times of vertices
4. It's different from DFS, see reference
5. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack
