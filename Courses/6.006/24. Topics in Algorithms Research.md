>## **Problems in parallel architecture**
1. SRAM, DRAM
2. When you have multiple processors, but all connect to the same SRAM. SRAM having 4 read ports at max, will proove to be a bottle-neck
3. Solution is being associating sram with each processor and have these processors in multiple numbers
4. Eventhough we will be using efficient shortest path algo based on congestion, it will take more cycles to access SRAM of another processor
5. Execution migration instead of data migration, which is one-way trip
6. Execution migration may involve more data transfer between processors rather than data migration. Solution being dynamic selection between two solutions
7. Dynamic programming

1. Computational Geometry
2. Folding
3. Self-assembly
4. Recreational algorithms


1. Memory transfer happens in blocks not words when going through bigger memory like SRAM -> DRAM
2. Cachebility algorithms - Binary search = O(log<sub>b</sub>n) and Sorting = O(n/b log<sub>c</sub>n/b) where b = size of block and c = number of blocks in SRAM
3. Fusion trees
4. Planar graphs; dijkstra in O(E) time
