1. Undirected, Directed graphs; based on ordered/unordered edges.
2. Web crawling, Social networking, Network Broadcast, Garbage Collection, Model Checking, Rubik's cube
3. Pocket Cube - 2*2*2
4. Configuration graph - Vertex for each possible state of the cube = 8! * 3<sup>8</sup> = Number Of Cubes, Number of Colors of each cube can be in = 264,539,520
5. Configuration graph - Edge for each possible move
6. Diameter of graph will be 11; 
7. Running/Space complexity = O(|V|+|E|)
8. Visit all reachable nodes from given node; in O(|V|+|E|)
9. Avoid duplicates/re-visiting vertices - We would spend infinite time
1. We will be using Queue
2. Add level at which a node is reached, starting at 0 for a starting node
3. BFS will give us tree, if we have saved parent node and a shortest path to reach a particular node; length will be level of node which is being stored

>### **Graph Representation**
1. Array of vertices and Array of edges, if we want to find neighbor of a vertex we need to iterate entire edges array
2. Adjacency lists : HashTable/Array which contains pointer to a linked list denoting all the links coming from a given vertex - Can represent multiple graphs for the same set of vertices by having different lists
3. Object Oriented: Store adjacency list in vertex object - Can only represent a single graph
4. Implicit representation: Adj(u) is a function and v.neighbours() is a function. Instead of having graph initially, we will compute at each level/vertex whenever required. Example: Rubik's cube to save space
