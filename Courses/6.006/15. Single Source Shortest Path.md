1. **Optimal sub-structure**
2. G(V, E, W) - Vertices, Edges, Weights
3. Multigraph
4. Bellman Ford Algorithm - Considers negative edges - O(VE) = O(Vpow3) as E = O(Vpow2)
5. Dijkstra Algorithm - O(VlogV+E) = O(VlogV)
6. A path is a sequence of edges and weight of the path is the summation of weights of edges
7. We can have negative weights in the graph
8. We can't have BFS, DFS for shortest path problems, because using them we will not get optimal solution
9. d(V) - current distance for a vertex on the path, II(V) - Predecessor of V on the path; These will be datastructures we need to track
1. Negative cycles, we need to eliminate
2. Termination condition was different in negative weight graph
3. Bellman-Ford algoright needs to detect negative cycles


>## **General Structure**
1. Initiate vertices, d[v] = Infinity and II(v) = nil
2. Optimum Sub-structure = Subpaths of a shortest path are shortest paths - To Read
