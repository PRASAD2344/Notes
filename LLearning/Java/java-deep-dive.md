Polymorphism - Static and Dynamic
Final class never be extended, will give compile time error
Access modified in subclass when implementing interfaces will give us compile time error
Extends allow us to create new classes based on existing ones

Static - Fixed to a class and can't be personalized by any instances of that class
Static methods/block can't access instance variables
Static field set two times by different objects and then print. We will have same value for each class
Number of runners in race using static field
Why main method is static? - Because at start no objects exists and is an empty field

Encapsulation - Keeping data with the class, just the responsibility of that class;
Having public fields will break Encapsulation

Inheritance - Triangle vs Composition - Diamond (Stronger i.e., belongs to vs Weaker)

Object is an capsule which contains data and behavior

No return type for constructor but implicity returns created object
