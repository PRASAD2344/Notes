Scheduling Problems - Runway Reservation System - Do operations in O(logn)
Reservations for future landings
Reserve request specifies landing time
Request t added to the set R if no other landing is scheduled with in k minutes
Remove  t from set R after place lands, we will check every 30 seconds

Sorted Arrays don't have fast insertions but BST do
Unlike heap which is represented as Arrays
parent(x), left(x), right(x), key(x)
For all nodes x, if y is in the left sub-tree of x key(y) <= key(x)
For all nodes x, if y is in the right sub-tree of x key(y) >= key(x)

BST -
Insertion O(h)
Find Min O(h)
Find Max O(h)
Next Larger/Next Smaller O(h)

Rank(t) - How many planes are expected to land at times <= t?
Augment the BST structure to look at the number of nodes below
