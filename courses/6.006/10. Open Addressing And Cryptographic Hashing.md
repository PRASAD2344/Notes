> ### **Open Addressing**
1. Chaining vs Open Addressing
2. No chaining
3. Will use arrays, one item per slot and so m >= n
4. Probing - Continue with hashing in different ways until we have an empty slot
5. Hash function specifies order of slots to probe for a key(for insert/delete/search)
6. H : key,trial count{1,....,m} -> {0,1,...,m-1}
7. Insert - Rehash until we find empty slot
8. Search - Rehash until we find key or we get empty slot denoting that key is not present
9. Delete problem, will disturb Insert and Search sequence
1. Probably we will keep it as occupied but not empty, once insertion is done in that slot we will have normal functioning

> ### **Probing Strategies**
1. Linear Probing h(k,i) = (h(k)+i) mod m where h(k) is ordinary hash function (prime hashing) - Clustering Problem
2. 0.01 < Load Factor i.e, n/m < 0.99, where clusters of size O(logn)
3. Double Hashing h(k,i) = (h1(k) + i.h2(k)) mod m; if h2(k) and m are relative prime

> ### **Uniform Hashing Analysis**
1. Not Simple Uniform Hashing which will talk about independence of hashing of keys
2. Each key is equally like to have any one of the m! permutations as it's probe sequence - Close to double hashing
3. Load Factor i.e., n/m, cost of operations like insert <= 1/1-Load Factor
4. Resize table if load factor goes beyond 0.5 or 0.6, so that we minimize 1/1-Load Factor
5. Resizing is important and is fairly different from chaining

> ### **Cyrptographic Hashing**
1. Password Storage
2. Crytpographic hash ?? - One way hash - given h(x)=Q it's every hard to find x so that h(x)=Q
