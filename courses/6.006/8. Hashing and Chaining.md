Dictionary in python - Abstract Data Type
Insert Item - Overwrite any existing key
Delete Item - 
Search Key - Find item with given key or throw key error

We can implement Dictionary using balanced AVL trees and do operations in O(logn) time
We can go down to search using constant time O(1) with high probability

Motivation
Doc Distance Problem
Database - Designed using Search Trees or HashKey
Spelling Correction
Compilers and Interpreters
Network Router
Substring search
String commonalities
File and Directory Synchronization
Cryptography

Simple Approach - Direct Access Table
Store items in array, indexed by key
Drawback
Keys may not be integers
Memory Usage particular about unused keys - If Key range is too great
Solution to 1 Drawback
Prehash - Map keys to non-negative integers
In theory, keys are finite and discrete i.e., String of bits
In python if hash function is not provided for objects, then it will consider memory address
Solution to 2 Drawback 
Hashing - Reduce universe of all keys(integers) down to reasonable size m for Table
Idea - m = number of keys(n) to store in Dictionary
So space problem is solved with 2n,3n space
Pigeon Hole Problem - Collision

Collision Solution - Chaining
Java HashMap Solution - LinkedList
Worst Case - O(n)

Simple Uniform Hashing - Method of prooving that worst case doesn't happens
Each key is equally likely to be hashed into any slot of the Table
Each key hashing is independent of other keys hashing
Analysis
Expected length of chain for n keys,m slots - n/m - 1/m+1/m+.....
Load factor of table = n/m
So, if we keep the table size as n, we have load factor of 1 and hence running time will be O(1)
In general running time will be O(1+length of chain) = O(1+load factor)

Hash Functions
Division Method - h(k) = k mod m
Not good if there is some realtion between k and m like both are even, so we are using only the half the table
It is good if m is prime
Multiplication Method - h(k) = [(a.k) mod 2poww]>>(w-r)
Universal Hashing Method - h(k) = [(ak+b) mod p] mod m
a,b are random between 0 and p-1
p will be prime number bigger that size of universe |u|
For worst case keys k1 != k2, probability that h(k1) = h(k2) is 1/m
