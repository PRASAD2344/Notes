>### **Table Increase On Insertions**
1. How to choose table length m, which we want it to be O(n) so that we get constant time operations on map
2. Idea: Start table as small with length power of 2 i.e., 8 and grow/shrink as necessary. Amortization problem
3. If n > m, grow table and then rehash everything based on new hash function. m -> m prime = 2m. O(n+m+m prime)
4. If I take m prime as m+1, we need to reshash everything on insertion and complexity will be O(npow2) which is bad
5. If I take m prime as 2m, complexity will be O(n) but for map we need constant time.
6. Amortization - Where the average is taken over all operations - Amortized Running Time - For table running time is O(1)

>### **Table Decrease On Deletions**
1. If m = n/2, then shrink - This is slow on frequent/continous deletion and insertion at m = n/2 element; Takes linear time
2. If m = n/4, then shrink m/2; >2 will suffice but take power of 2; n<=m<=4n
Amortized time becomes constant for k insertions and Deletions
3. Lists - Table Doubling - Deletion Constant < Insertion Constant - Constant Amortized
4. We can have two arrays at same time for insertions and deletions, one which is double. So if reach limit, we can switch immediately.

>### **String Matching - Is Substring - Karp Rabin - Hashing - O(|s|+|t|)**
1. Rolling Hashing
2. Division Method For Hashing - h(k) = k mod m where m is a random prime which is >= |s| i.e., substring length to match
3. Integer/Base Arthimetic
