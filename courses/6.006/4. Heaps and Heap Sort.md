Heaps - An array visualized as a nearly complete binary tree
Priority Queue - Abstract Data Type
Insert(S,X) - Insert X into S
Max(S) - Return element X of S with the largest key
Extract_Max(S) - Return & Remove element X of S from the Queue
Increase_Key(S,X,K) - Increase key of X's key to the new value K 
Max Heaps - Key of a node >= Keys of children
Min Heaps - Key of a node <= Keys of children
Parent = i/2
Left Child = 2i
Right Child = 2i+1

build_max_heap - Complexity -> O(n)
Recursively calling
max_heapify(A,i) - Correct a single violation of the heap property in a subtree's root; Assume that the tree rooted at left(i) and right(i) are max Heaps - O(logn)
Complexity - To Look at weekend

heap sort - O(nlogn)
