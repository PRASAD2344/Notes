Height of a node = max(height(left),height(right))+1; For empty child we will height as -1 to eliminate few checks
Datastructure augmentation to store height of every node
AVL trees- Require height of left & right child to be differed by at most -1 to +1
AVL trees are balanced i.e., height of tree should be log(n)
