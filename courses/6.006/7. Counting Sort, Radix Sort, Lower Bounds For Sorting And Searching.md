Comparision Model - Computation Model - Proove Lower Model
Binary Search Tree - Search - O(logn)
Merge Sort - Sort - O(nlogn)
RAM Model of Computation

Comparision Model - Height of tree is equated to complexity
All input items are black boxes(ADTs)
Only operations allowed are comparisions(<,>,<=,>=,=)
Time cost = Number Of comparisions

Decision Tree - Any comparision algorithm can be viewed as a tree of all possible comparisions and their outcomes and the resulting answer

BST Worst Case Search - Height/Depth of the tree

Random Access Machine Model

Linear Time Sortings
Integer Sorting
- Assume keys we are sorting are integers and are in some range; For convenience we can take positivie integers belonging to {0,1,...,k-1}
- Each fits in a word as words can be processed in constant time

Counting Sort - O(n+k) - TODO - We will have list and if k is large we are not better position

https://brilliant.org/wiki/radix-sort/
Radix Sort - O((n+b)d) = O((n+b)log(b)k+1) = To minimise we take b as n = O(nc) = Integers are reasonably small we will get linear time = if k<=npowc
Use Counting Sort as sub-routine
Imagine integer as base b
Number of digits for d = log(b)k+1
Sort integers by least significant digit
.
.
Sort integer by most significant digit
